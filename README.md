# Ibrahim Fayomi - **Cybersecurity Analyst | SOC Analyst | AI Security Engineer**

I'm **Ibrahim Fayomi**, a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in SOC operations, threat detection, vulnerability management, continuous security monitoring, AI security engineering, and defensive security. I work across cloud and on-premises environments, focusing on visibility, detection, identity security, and risk reduction. My work encompasses the entire security lifecycle: I design and harden systems, monitor and investigate threats, assess risk, and enhance detection based on real-world attack behavior. I approach security from a blue team perspective, with practical exposure to controlled offensive simulations used strictly to strengthen defense and response. This repository documents how I think, build, monitor, and secure systems in ways that reflect real enterprise security work.

## Professional Focus

SOC monitoring & incident analysis | Identity & access management with Active Directory | Vulnerability assessment & risk analysis | Network security & traffic inspection | Threat detection & log analysis | Threat hunting using MITRE ATT&CK | Phishing defense, digital & email forensics | Malware analysis & security investigations | AI in Cybersecurity for Automation, stimulating attack techniques, exploit logic & monitoring | log analysis & alert triage | detecting abnormal behaviour & stealthy attacks | supporting threat hunting & MITRE ATT&CK mapping | accelerating malware & phishing analysis.
